# Ludum Dare 48 Jam Entry
## Theme: Deeper and Deeper

# Ideas
- Kinda like a roguelike Impossible Mission cross over?
- There is an overworld where you pick rooms to enter to find pieces you need to unlock the next level which is further down the cave system
- The elevator travels further down to the boss lair
- It's exploration and puzzle? What kind of puzzle? Just pick up the pieces?
- Mechanics
	- Overworld - Move between rooms and select which room you want to tackle.
	- Rooms - Filled with killer robots in a platform style game
	- Search - Search the objects in the room to find the items you need
	- Puzzle - X number of pieces need to be found before you can face the evil doctor
	- Evil doctor - How does he get defeated? Doesn't. Burrows away? Puzzle fight?

## Overworld
Move UDLR to select a room. There are at least four rooms per level. Move over to a room and press the jump button to enter.

There is a locked elevator in the first level. The elevator is always in the same position. On subsequent levels, you can go back up in case you miss something you might need.

## Rooms
Rooms are laid out as platforms. Each platform has either robots, things to search or nothing. Elevators would be a nice to have.

### Room Randomness
Each level contains four rooms picked from a random smattering of rooms. There is a possibility for objects to be placed in certain positions in each room.

## Search
Things that you can find:

- Puzzle pieces that make up a picture of an object 
- A key to open the next level
- Nothing
- Control cards for the computer monitors

## Inventory
Shows the puzzle pieces obtained and the objects collected.

## Computer Terminal
Can be used to freeze robots or reset elevators to the starting positions in the room

## Evil Doctor
The evil doctor is defeated if you can bring with you the parts you need to defeat him. There are a couple of red herrings?? in there.
